This is a simple app demoing my Node-Twilio library.

TxtAtlas puts your texts on the map!

Texts are sent to a Twilio number, and then stored in a Redis database. When you visit the website, all the texts are represented as pins using the excellent Google Maps API.

This little project makes use of lots of great open source software: Node.js, Redis, Node-Redis, and Node-Twilio. It is built with two outstanding REST APIs as well: the Google Maps and Twilio APIs.
